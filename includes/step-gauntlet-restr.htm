            The Gauntlet is largely the same flow regardless the category or ruleset, as your attack is artificially capped at 1 inside. Besides the first wave, your own personal preference for how to tackle the Gauntlet is largely fine.
        </p>

        <h3>Fairy Wave</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="py-1">
                Immediately activate the fairy wave (far left). Your objective in this wave will be to damage down to peril state to activate Orange Peril Ring for the remaining waves.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Stand on the upper-right of the arena and start sniping the fairies as they spawn. You should be able to take out 10 before any become a threat.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                You'll quickly run out of mana--run through the dead fairies to replenish. Rinse and repeat until you are in peril state, then down the last fairy.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Remaining Waves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="py-1">
                Again, preference: My personal order: Fairies, Mages, Rudelings, Garden Knights, Frogs, Skeletons. I like using the extra lure for the Mages wave.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                You do not need to activate the health wave to complete the Gauntlet.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Laurels</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="py-1">
                While the Laurels chest is spawning in, <span class="text-warning">equip bombs</span>. As soon as you acquire Laurels, exit the Gauntlet to the south.
            </li>
        </ol>
