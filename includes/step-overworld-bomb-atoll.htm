                Descend south to where you bombed the bushes and enter.

                Walk past the rudeling to bait a sword swing and run west to the hidden bomb chest.

                Walk digitally (keyboard or remapped D-pad) up-left and down-left into the wall, throw the fire bomb, and roll away. If done correctly, it should explode and burn the bushes on the other side of the wall.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Run around to and through the burning bushes (to avoid aggro) and to the teleporter. Warp to Far Shore and to Atoll (lower-left).
