                Run north of the checkpoint and grapple left to a tuning fork. Head up and open the chest for an <span class="badge text-bg-light">ATT upgrade</span>. <span class="text-info">During the chest-opening animation, equip Muffling Bell.</span>

            <li class="py-1">
                Run west/left, enter Dark Tomb, and immediately exit. This is to set your Continue point (and a good place for an auto-split).

            <li class="py-1">
                Run west and open the chest between the rudelings for <span class="badge text-bg-danger">Peppers (2)</span>. The timing is somewhat tight, but it's pretty easy if you ignore them.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Climb the nearby ladder and grapple NE twice. Obtain the <span class="badge text-bg-warning">Wand</span>. Immediately pause, quit, and continue. Activate orb (to place it in your paw) and re-enter Dark Tomb.
