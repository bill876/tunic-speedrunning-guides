                Run up the stairs and enter the larger room. Head right, down the stone ramp, and in a small arc to the top point of the fuse. Power it; you should not aggro any enemies if done correctly.

                Once activated, roll up-right and up the stone ramp, through the next room, and into the Golden Door room. Cut left to the left fuse and power it. Enemies may approach but don't flinch.

                The Siege Engine teleporter is now active! Run south down both sets of stairs, aggro some enemies and run right into the checkpoint room. <span class="text-info">Quickly equip Glass Cannon, orb, bomb and stick</span> and start upgrading to ATT 2. A custodian should disptach you quickly, sending you back to Overworld and skipping some of the upgrade animation.
