            This will require a lot of practice, memorization and visual cues you can develop for yourself. It may also help to practice this with the lantern to get a sense of what it looks like.

                Use the orb to grapple a box out of the way (it's faster that breaking them with the stick or a bomb).

                Roll into the water and work your way through the cave in the dark. In and out of the water twice, left and around some boxes, into another tight hallway, past a couple of spiders (roll past the second), and emerge into the main waterfall chamber.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Walk to the front of the waterfall, face East (screen: up-right) and throw a lure. After the spiders leave the waterfall, enter and obtain <span class="badge text-bg-primary">Muffling Bell</span>. Immediately equip it as you are exiting.
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Tiptoe across the chamber to a cave entrance across the room. Curve clockwise around the cavern, across the bridge, past more spiders, and into the fortress block. Run through the empty hallway and turn left.

            <li class="py-1">
                As soon as you pass through the doorway, <span class="badge text-bg-light">toss the ice bomb</span> at the custodian and roll away / run past. It should freeze them, allowing you to run to the next room, power the fuse, and exit. <span class="text-warning">If this fails, simply exit the next room and re-enter.</span>
