            <li>Approach Heir until prompt appears.</li>
            <li>Press Pause and scroll down to "Quit to Menu".</li>
            <li>Press "B" on controller and immediately press confirm (usually "A").</li>
            <li>
                If it actually quits to the main menu, congrats, it (probably) worked;
                if the cutscene plays as normal, sorry it didn't work this time.
                Be sure not to die in this cutscene and as soon as you can
                your UI back, pause, quit and continue.

            The timing between B and A is MUCH tighter at 120Hz than 60Hz. The same muscle memory will likely not work.
