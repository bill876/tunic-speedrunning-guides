        <h2>NE Fuse (3)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Walk down the right staircase and run against the farthest right point.</li>
            <li>Target the group of crabs and fire a wand shot.</li>
            <li>As soon as it strikes, re-target another crab and <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ice-grapple">ice-grapple</a> it.</li>
            <li>Immediately and quickly run up and activate the fuse.</li>

        <div class="alert alert-warning">
            The crabs are unfortunately a bit RNG; consider freezing one to jam them up.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>As soon as the fuse lights, orb down to the hook to the south and walk south along the brick catwalk.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>SE Fuse (4)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Target and <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ice-grapple">ice-grapple</a> the south-most small crab and head SW.</li>
            <li>Orb across the water to the lower hook.</li>
            <li>Run past the crabs and around to the SW point, up a couple ladders, and activate the last fuse.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            The larger crab can be a good way to damage down to critical HP.
