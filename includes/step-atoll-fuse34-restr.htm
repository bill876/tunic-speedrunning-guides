        <h2>NW Fuse (3)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Walk down the left staircase and 180 behind it to the beach.</li>
            <li>Walk to the inner corner and target/wand the frog.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">
            This timing is very tight; if you are slow here, the frog may walk away.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Run along the beach until you are about to be visible again, target and grapple the frog down to the beach.</li>
            <li>Run past the smaller frog, grapple up to the hook, and run to and power the fuse.</li>
            <li>As soon as the fuse is active, move to the inside pocket of the brick wall and target/orb down to the lower hook.</li>
            <li>Immediately re-target the hook to the lower-right and grapple to it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>SW Fuse (4)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Run south toward the next fuse, hugging the lower side of the area to avoid aggro-ing enemies.</li>
            <li>When you reach the mountain, run up the ramps to the fuse and activate.</li>
            <li>Pause, quit, and continue as soon as the power line lights up.</li>
        </ul>
