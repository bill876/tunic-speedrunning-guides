                The chest here is a full flask. It is never necessary but a good backup. Taking it burns about 5 seconds. It's completely up to you!

                Climb the ladders and stairs up to the Eastern Bell. Strike the Bell with the stick. <span class="text-warning">Make sure Glass Cannon is unequipped&mdash;you cannot strike the bell if it is enabled.</span>

                As soon as you strike the bell, walk right to the coiled rope and drop it. <span class="text-info fw-bold">Equip Glass Cannon</span> while the animation is playing.

                Climb down the rope, head left, burn the bushes blocking the shortcut, and exit. Depending on the random location of the slimes, either avoid or kill them.
