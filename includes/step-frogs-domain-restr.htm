                Climb down the ladders, exit left to the hallway, and divert south into the secret room. Open the chest for some firecrackers. <span class="text-warning">The timing on this is tight: if you flub the ladders or entry, just Quit to Menu and try again.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="py-1">
                Travel counter-clockwise around the domain. Roll past the large frogs and roll to dodge their hook tongues. Take the shortcut down the ladder and to the center of the room.

                <span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">Sneak to chest for 100 bits.</span>

                Run back down the stairs, sneak around to the right, and run to the lever to open the gate. The frogs will aggro--don't worry about them. 99% of the time you will have time to escape without taking damage. Run to the open gate and into the next room.

                <span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">Open chest for ATT upgrade.</span>

                Head right and descending into the slorm cave. Roll just before entering the water and exit right. Ascend the ladders, curve around, and drop into the sanctuary to grab <span class="badge bg-primary">the orb</span>.
            </li>

                Pause, quit and continue to return to the entrance of Frog's Domain.
