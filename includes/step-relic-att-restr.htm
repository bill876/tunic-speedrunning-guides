                Position yourself against the bush next to the gate. Dash up against the bush until you clip into the gate and through. <span class="text-warning"> Note: the stick position for dashing through the gate is very specific. It's about 80% up and 10% left of the analog stick range.</span>

                Dash to the Hero's Grave, play, and dash quickly to obtain the ATT Relic. As soon as the light trails meet at the fox, quit and continue.
