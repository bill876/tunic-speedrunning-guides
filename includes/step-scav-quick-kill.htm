        <h1>Boss: Scavenger Quick Kill</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="lead">
            Pull them into the death plane with the orb
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#speedrun-code">speedrunner code</a> is active (not as applicable on NG+)</li>
            <li>Equipment required: Orb, Dagger, Wand</li>
            <li>Fire a vanilla wand beam directly at the Scavenger before crossing the catwalk to begin the fight.</li>
            <li>RNG time! We now have to wait until the Scavenger is at the edge of the arena.</li>
            <li>
                There are two outcomes to this fight:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The Scavenger does their "jump-downthrust" attack at the edge of the arena:
                        grapple them from minimum distance and the fight is over
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Scavenger runs to the edge of the arena: you must immediately
                        <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#irc">freeze them</a>, wait for the ice to decay,
                        and grapple them into the pit just as the ice is breaking. 
                        Because the ice-decay explosion will knock you back, you must move a bit away from the ledge before grappling the boss.
                        But if you walk back <b>too far</b>, you will grapple the Scavenger to your platform, and the
                        run is basically over.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                It is very tricky to get into the proper position to execute on outcome 2, and there are various ways to do so. You'll have to experiment to find what works for you.
                <ul>
                    <li>While at the absolute edge, tap "A" and "S" on keyboard (down+left) 3x with the lightest/quickest taps</li>
                    <li>While at the absolute edge, orb + down-left, orb+down, LT/target + orb</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If done correctly, Scav will fall into the pit, die, and you will almost immediately be in control. If you have any mana left, a quick wand shot sometimes makes them die faster.</li>
            <li>Obtain the <span class="badge bg-primary">Blue Key</span>, equip a bomb, and use it to death warp.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the death animation to menu.</li>
        </ul>
