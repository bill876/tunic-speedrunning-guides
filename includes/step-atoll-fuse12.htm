        <h2>NW Fuse (1)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Walk down the left staircase and 180 behind it to the beach.</li>
            <li>Walk to the inner corner and target/wand the frog.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">
            This timing is very tight; if you are slow here, the frog may walk away.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>When the frog approaches, <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ice-grapple">ice-grapple</a> him and run to activate the fuse.</li>
            <li>The frog will thaw, approach and may attack but typically will not hit you. You can <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#irc">ice-beam</a> him while praying if you wish to be safe.</li>
            <li>As soon as the fuse is active, move to the inside pocket of the brick wall and target/orb down to the lower hook.</li>
            <li>Immediately re-target the hook to the lower-right and grapple to it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>SW Fuse (2)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Run south toward the next fuse, hugging the lower side of the area to avoid aggro-ing enemies.</li>
            <li>When you reach the mountain, walk behind it to the NE edge and <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ice-grapple">ice-grapple</a> the small blue bird at the top.</li>
            <li>Move away from the frozen bird and activate this fuse.</li>
            <li>Pause, quit, and continue as soon as the power line lights up.</li>
