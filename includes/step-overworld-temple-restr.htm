            Warp to the Overwold, open the Sealed Temple, and drop keys.

        <ul>
            <li>Warp to the Overworld West. Use the wand to clear bushes.</li>
            <li>Activate the Golden Door. While it is opening, switch on Glass Cannon.</li>
            <li>Run to the first key slot, place the key, and immediately pause, quit, and continue.</li>
            <li>Do this again for the second key slot.</li>
            <li>For the third key, the fastest way is to toss a bomb onto the steps, walk up, activate the key cutscene, and let the bomb explode, initiating a death warp after the key is placed.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            You can also repeat the same process as the first two keys and throw the bomb when you re-appear. It is slightly slower, but it's much, much safer and you get death animation time to menu.
