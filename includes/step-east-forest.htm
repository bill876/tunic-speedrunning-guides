                Walk forward, bait the rudeling, and roll past them into the inside border of bushes and attack with the stick to set them all on fire. A well-placed swipe will allow you to roll to the next ladder. If not, quickly clear a path&mdash;<span class="text-danger fw-bold">you can easily die here at 1 HP</span>.

The fire should dispatch the rudelings while you do. Climb down and go into the open gate.
